# Writing-Functions-in-Python
You've done your analysis, built your report, and trained a model. What's next? Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. I have worked on useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. I have also used best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation.
